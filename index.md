<p class="name">
My name is Julien Zamor.<br>
On the Internet I'm known as @smwhr.

**By day**, I'm the CTO of [cit.io](https://cit.io) improving cities one bus line at a time. But you may know me from [TroisYaourts](https://troisyaourts.com), the company I founded and ran from 2014 to 2021 where I used to be the Technical and Creative Director.

**By night**, I used to watch loads of movies and I've been making [silly, short games](https://smwhr.itch.io), be them narrative, lo-fi or conceptual since 1999.

In between, I take care of my two lovely little boys.

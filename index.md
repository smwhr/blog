<p class="name">
My name is Julien Zamor.<br>
On the Internet I'm known as @smwhr.
</p>

**By day**, I'm a front-end engineer at [cit.io](https://cit.io) improving cities one bus line at a time. But you may know me from [TroisYaourts](https://troisyaourts.com), the company I founded and run from 2014 to 2021 where I used to be the Technical and Creative Director.

**By night**, I used to watch loads of movies and I've been making [silly, short games](https://smwhr.itch.io), be them narrative, lo-fi or conceptual since 1999.

In between, I take care of my two lovely little boys.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/smwhr), [instagram](https://instagram.com/smwhr_), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-zamor-966a9668/), [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/doctorju), [itch.io](https://smwhr.itch.io) and below are the blogposts I've written since 2003.

> I think, sad to say, that _Little Miss Sunshine_ is the roommate of the girl you really want to nail (all heart but not quite hot enough to get a rise out of you), _Babe_l is the Euro girl who doesn't shave her armpits; you're attracted to her but you aren't sure you're up to the task of actually sleeping with her. Truth is, you're intimidated by her mystery. _The Queen_ is like the smart but unsexy other friend who doesn't smile much but will marry well. _Letters from Iwo Jima_ is the girl who always does well in school but never quite enters your circle of friends. You eye her from afar thinking, well, it would be too embarrassing to date her but I kind of am attracted to her. She's the one who plays the violin _AND_ the cello. _The Departed_ is the hot one. So hot, in fact, that you can't even bring her home to meet your parents. If only you could put the brain of the _Letters_ chick into the body of _The Departed_, add in the friendly but unsexy _Little Miss Sunshine_ roommate for a heart, put the clothes on from the _Babel_ girl and you have the perfect date.

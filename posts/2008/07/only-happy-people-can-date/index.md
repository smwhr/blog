And I'm happy only when I'm in New York.

Unfortunately, targets, even when fitting the canon stereotype (by order of importanceÂ : black hair, red shoes, green eyes) are usually too young, too the sister of someone else, too... list stops there at the moment, I've only been there for two days.

I've only four episodes of Entourage left. And in case you didn't know, tomorrow is my birthday (technically speaking and according to this server's time, I'm twenty-three years old already).

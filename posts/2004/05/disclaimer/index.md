They think that blogging is a kind of torture. But I don't think so.

Blogging is an action which takes place in just one instant, because blogging is putting his own feeling in a textfield and intrinsically, feelings stay in mind just one instant before leaving.  
The work I choose is to catch these feelings and to write them.  
Your work is to read, to judge, perhaps to learn from this cluster of feeling.

I never read what I write. I write and then, I forget.

If I read what I wrote, it might certainly have been a kind of torture.  
Then I don't.
